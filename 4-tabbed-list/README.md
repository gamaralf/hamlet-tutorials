# Tabbed List

This example uses tab styles from Bootstrap and shows how simple a tabbed list implementation is with Hamlet.

## New in this example

Make sure to run

`npm install --save-dev coffeeify`

Notice that we added a `browserify` key to `package.json` with the `coffeeify` transform. This allows us to write CoffeeScript and have browserify transform it into JavaScript when built.

## Viewing the example

Run `sh build.sh` and then `open index.html` to view the example in your browser.
